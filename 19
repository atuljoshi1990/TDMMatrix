Donald Trump is releasing his second budget Monday, and … it’s a Donald Trump budget. In the government, budgets are statements of priorities rather than determining actual spending, but a statement of priorities is always a good way to assess a politician. And Trump’s priorities aren’t even a little bit surprising: defense spending and going after immigrants, yes; the services American families rely on, no.

Trump’s budget will lay out “an aggressive set of spending reforms” to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over a decade, according to a preview released by the White House on Sunday.

“Just like every American family, the Budget makes hard choices: fund what we must, cut where we can, and reduce what we borrow,” White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said in a statement.

Maybe if Republicans hadn’t already made the choice to give corporations and wealthy people a giant tax break, the budget choices would be a little less hard. Except the language of hard choices is dishonest here: people like Donald Trump and Mick Mulvaney revel in slashing programs that matter to middle- and working-class families.

But there’s one thing that definitely won’t be cut:

Trump is seeking a massive boost to the Pentagon to allow for a “ready, larger, and more lethal military,” the White House said in the preview.

Gotta have that shiny hardware for Trump’s parades. Also in line for some Trump budget cash: border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s ability to detain and imprison immigrants. And while Trump is finally at least talking about spending some money on the opioid crisis, he’s looking at a law enforcement approach much more than treatment and recovery.

But when you cut through the rhetoric against immigrants and in favor of hundreds of millions of dollars for unmanned tankers and against Medicaid and food stamps, remember this: all the talk of “hard choices” hinges on Republicans already having made the choice to give corporations and rich people a huge, deficit-exploding tax cut.

An Authoritarian state requires a war economy to maintain it’s power.

And an authoritarian state with a strong radical xtian right theocratic element to it has a core belief that government has no business at all in any sort of social safety nets.  They want all social programs left to churches.  The current proposed cuts in ‘rump’s budget are viewed as a starting point.  The goal for them is the complete elimination of any taxes being used for government social services.

It’s all such a sham, growth isn’t going to pay for the tax cuts.  The deficit will balloon sending borrowing rates soaring, how many T-bills can we possibly sell before the whole world is glutted with our debt???   We, the US, did it privately with inflated real estate prices and shoddy loan products, until the world was choked with our bad policies and bad debt.  This will not end well, it never does.  These “conservatives” that voted for these republicans and Trump in exchange for “low taxes” will never, ever get it.  It’s all such a sham, an infuriating sham.

So the spending is fine with you?  Sorry, not on that page, the MIC  gets far too much.  Now if you double pay of the troops, reduce substantially the number in uniform and cut the 800 bases maintained bigtime and substantially increase veterans benefits, now you are talking but that is not what the increases EVER mean.

Sierrareal1  Michiganmitch Feb 12 · 10:40:35 AM
The problem is that when you say “Fuck the Military”; there is virtually no way for a Military person to not hear “Fuck the Soldiers / Service Members”.

I’m glad to see you clarified; but it would be far more practical to explain your position with a more succinct post in the first place.

Also, just to note another problem with stating “Fuck the Military”; the fact is, in large part, “The Military” has been opposed to a significant number of “projects” that have resulted in the huge budget increases of the past several decades. They’re not clamoring for these “budget busting” increase’s in large part. Military Leadership is generally (no pun intended) not comprised of “total idiots”. There are some (and they seem to get the majority of the headlines), but most are pragmatic, educated, and intelligent individuals who are motivated by “serving the Nation”. They fully understand how negatively the huge Military budget impacts the Country.

Surely this approach will be the undoing of the Republican Party for years.  It is just too obvious when they pass a tax cut for the rich, then immediately talk austerity for the rest of us.  Surely all but the most extremist Republican voters will see that the Republican constituency is the few rich guys.

I’m betting that most of the tankers refilling fighter jets are on autopilot.  Autopilots are more consistent and if programmed “correctly,” don’t screw up like human pilots.  I think it would be better to say, I want a live pilot aboard in case the guy who wrote the autopilot software screwed up.

VClib  lyleoross Feb 12 · 12:48:33 PM
I imagine when they are in refueling mode they run on autopilot. But when they take off, fully loaded, and when they are in flight (even on auto pilot) I really like the idea that we have an experienced pilot there for safety reasons.

Actually, it’s an advanced money hole that specially designed to suck money.

The Navy's unmanned tanker program had been renamed and re-envisioned multiple times as officials juggle requirements and capabilities. The program was formerly called CBARS, Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System, before being renamed the MQ-25.

She was hoping for a (violent?) revolution...I’m hoping there won’t be the need for one.

But when the massive tax cut for the rich finally hits the fan, and the rest of us are either unemployed, losing insurance coverage, losing the retirement benefits we’ve paid into (including S.S., Medicare),

and having to pee into a cup to get any assistance,  perhaps she ‘ll get her wish.

Sierrareal1  Things Come Undone Feb 12 · 10:59:49 AM
I’m not sure “when was the last time a (X) President actually reduced the National debt” is a reasonable question for two reasons.

1. The President doesn’t control spending; that’s Congress’ role.

2. To “reduce the debt” would presume that there was a significant period during which a combination of several factors all came together in such a way as to provide significantly more revenue to the Federal Government than the “cost” of the Government functions and/or the things the Government felt they could do for the Citizens with those surpluses.

The last time we had any significant Surpluses were, as anyone here should know, at the end of the Clinton administration. GWB gave those surpluses away and immediately proposed the huge tax breaks for the wealthy that sent us into a downward spiral that we still haven’t recovered from.

President Obama made progress on reducing the Deficit, but he was prevented from the level of success he might have had with may of his proposals by an intransigent Congress for the majority of his term.

This is typical of thinking on the Right, that we wouldn’t lose wars if our military was more “lethal”, had bigger and better hardware, faster planes, etc etc. It’s TOTALLY backwards thinking and flies in the face of the ethos “Fight smarter, not harder”. 

More tanks and planes and missiles will not make a spit of difference in Afghanistan.

Is there any more specific data about how they want to allocate the defense spending? I’m guessing it’s bigger, badder, more compensatory missiles and such and not cyberwarfare? Or social/econo warfare or anything that might be more useful on the shifting paradigm of the battlefield?

Using Mulvaney’s familly budget analogy, the current occupant of 1600 Penn. Ave. & the repugs are saying that the familly should make the following choices: purchase more guns & bullets, put up a wall around the house, and throw undesirable familly members & staff out rather than providing the members of the familly with education, medical care, food, clean air & water, and supporting the grand parents. For any familly that truely cares for its members these choices would be disastrous.

We should be deluging Congress with the demand that the military budget includimg the homeland security should be cut by at least 10% and funding for the social safety net, education, and services to improve the health and well being of Americans (EPA, CDC, OSHA, etc.) increased. It saddens me that the only thing that our government can consistently find more money for is more bombs & bullets.

This is what ALWAYS happens when we have Republican administrations. And the end results are always disastrous for the nation. Then we elect Democrats to clean up the mess, and eight years later we do it all over again. It’s a cycle of destruction that is slowly killing this nation.

We can’t afford health care, food stamps, housing assistance or education, but we can always afford an endless supply of military hardware. And nothing is more expensive, less useful to the average citizen, or provides less economic return on investment, than military hardware.

Your comment reminds me of Eisenhower’s Chance for Peace speech.

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.[1][5]

Way back in 1953.

Orwell, a few years earlier:

The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed.

Trump needs to have some brand new shiny tanks, missiles, and planes for his “parades.” (can’t use any equipment from during the Obama years) He will also need money to modify Pennsylvania Ave. into a giant parade ground which he will call “necessary” infrastructure for national defense.

I feel compelled to ask those posting here to please distinguish in your comments between terms like “the military”, “the Pentagon" and the like.  Some seem to use these interchangeably and that is, imo, unfair to the rank and file of the armed forces, and frankly a lot of the Pentagon staff as well.  The decisions many are decrying are being made by the Trump admin and Congress, not “the military”.  To the contrary, “the military” has been telling DC to stop this shit for 30 years but congresscritters have defense plants in their districts so … nope, more tanks and planes for ya, guys and gals, sorry we couldn’t get to those meal kits this time around, but we’ll for sure hook you up next year”.

If nothing else, when someone says something like “fuck the military”, they are essentially saying “fuck you” to thousands of the very sorts of people they might otherwise staunchly defend.

Thank you for your time, enjoy your day.

You’re right, and speaking as one who enlisted at around the same time (seems like), a lot don’t have many other options aside from military service.

No doubt there’s plenty of “hoowah kill kill kill pray for war” types, but I’d bet that’s a minority.

How the public responds to and interacts with the armed forces is separate matter entirely and again, it’s unfair to blame the object of worship for the reactions of others.  No one I ever met while I was in or since struck me as the type to seek glorification, and the most frequent response one hears from troops who get called “hero” is that they are not.

Nevertheless, the military is being used more and more to simply beat up on more and more countries for little to no reason in so many cases. That situation is not going to end well for us, and I don’t feel like cutting anybody any slack for being involved in it. I don’t feel proud that I was in the AF in the Vietnam period. I served enlisted because I refused to follow through with my initial (ROTC) plans to be a pilot. After thinking about it, I realized that having a cheap path to a lucrative career as an airline pilot was not worth killing a lot of people who were no threat to us. I will say that for myself.

Come you masters of war

You that build all the guns

You that build the death planes

You that build the big bombs

You that hide behind walls

You that hide behind desks

I just want you to know

I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin’

But build to destroy

You play with my world

Like it’s your little toy

You put a gun in my hand

And you hide from my eyes

And you turn and run farther

When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old

You lie and deceive

A world war can be won

You want me to believe

But I see through your eyes

And I see through your brain

Like I see through the water

That runs down my drain

You fasten the triggers

For the others to fire

Then you set back and watch

When the death count gets higher

You hide in your mansion

As young people’s blood

Flows out of their bodies

And is buried in the mud

You’ve thrown the worst fear

That can ever be hurled

Fear to bring children

Into the world

For threatening my baby

Unborn and unnamed

You ain’t worth the blood

That runs in your veins

How much do I know

To talk out of turn

You might say that I’m young

You might say I’m unlearned

But there’s one thing I know

Though I’m younger than you

Even Jesus would never

Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question

Is your money that good

Will it buy you forgiveness

Do you think that it could

I think you will find

When your death takes its toll

All the money you made

Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die

And your death’ll come soon

I will follow your casket

In the pale afternoon

And I’ll watch while you’re lowered

Down to your deathbed

And I’ll stand o’er your grave

’Til I’m sure that you’re dead

The business of the US is weapons and war since Vietnam.  It began in WWII when everyone else destroyed themselves.  Trump is also big into oil, but using whose money is a question.  Like the Koch, Adelson and all the Trumpco people life of others is not important.  Plants, Animals, People are all disposable in exchange for gold.  Their reach is shown by the easy lies told by their “base” who think by supporting the fat cats gold will trickle down on them.  The other part they pretend to ignore are the mass deaths they cause where they go.  More than weapons they produce genocide.

Why are we complaining? We know that Congressional Democrats won’t put up more than a perfunctory ‘show’ fight against this, and will meekly pass it after being granted a few small crumbs. After all; they don’t want to give the slightest impression of being ‘anti-military’, or looking ‘partisan’ in a news cycle.

The default interpretation to everything that comes out of the White House has to be, “Yeah, good luck with that.” Nothing, not the tax bill nor the spending bill, have remotely resembled anything that Trump’s people have proposed. It’s not even the filibuster that would prevent this.  This wouldn’t pass a straight up-or-down vote now (let alone after November).

I’ve read this budget also contains deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid & the Food Stamp programs. Unfortunately, fiscal, conservative, christian, congressional, Republicans supporting these drastic cuts, don’t understand their actions are going to anger even the most loyal GOP voters when retirees hear their physicians can no longer treat them, because of these new Medicare cuts, or when families are told Medicaid no longer pays for the care of their ill, elderly family members, in nursing homes….… and they need to come get them.  I hope they also get tired hearing from social service organizations, community organizers, medical professionals, clergy & others living in their districts that taking away food stamps from struggling low income families & disabled/mentally challenged adults is Mean, Hateful & Un-Christian.

We do not do a good job at maintaining our current military hardware, and wetware (people). Why are we spending money to buy new hardware, that is yet to be proven in battle. 

Yes, there are new threats that need to be addressed, before we purchase new unproven hardware let’s have a good review to determine that the current hardware will not do the job and were necessary modify it to do the new job better.  Good example of this is the A-10 Warthog. Venerable aircraft that has and continues to serve our military’s mission.

With this tax scheme for the wealthy, the country will lack the ability to respond to an economic or environmental crisis because there will not be enough wealthy people to create sufficient demand to counter the downward spiral in demand that the event will cause. Those who do not remember their history are doomed to repeat it. Its’ also worse for those who know their history when those who do not remembered or know it are in charge.
