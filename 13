Major U.S. stock indexes rose slightly Tuesday, gaining for a third consecutive session, though investors remained on edge ahead of a key report on inflation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 180 points earlier in the session before recovering those losses to eke out a slight gain. Despite the intraday swing, investors appeared to avoid making any drastic trades ahead of Wednesday’s Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer prices.
