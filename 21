An archive photo of a Saratov Airlines plane

Russian aircraft crashes after takeoff from Moscow
The Saratov Airlines flight was carrying 65 passengers and six crew.

By	GIULIA PARAVICINI	2/11/18, 2:08 PM CET Updated 2/11/18, 2:13 PM CET
A Russian airplane carrying 71 people — 65 passengers and six crew members — crashed Sunday after taking off from Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport en route to Orsk.

The plane operated by Saratov Airlines crashed in the Moscow region likely killing all passengers on board, Russian news agency Interfax said, citing a source in the emergency services.

“Presumably, the plane crashed near the village of Argunovo, and there were no chances of survival with crew and passengers,” the source reportedly said.
