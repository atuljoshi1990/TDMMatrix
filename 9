Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, said he paid $130,000 out of his own pocket to an adult-movie actress who alleged a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.

The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Mr. Cohen made the payment in October 2016 through a limited-liability company in exchange for the adult-movie star, Stephanie Clifford, signing a nondisclosure agreement about her allegations of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump in 2006.
